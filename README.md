# Taste of Home Platform: Bridging Home Cooks and Consumers

## Overview

"Taste of Home" is an innovative platform designed to connect passionate home cooks with consumers seeking authentic, home-cooked meals. Through engaging conversations with international students, we uncovered a diversity of culinary preferences, challenges, and aspirations, shaping the vision for a service that addresses the gap between genuine home cooking and the market demand for affordable, quality meal options.

## User Insights Summary

Our research highlighted several key insights from international students, revealing varied culinary needs:

- **Skilled Cooks vs. Dining Options**: A skilled cook expressed dissatisfaction with the authenticity and pricing of local Indian restaurants, indicating a market for a platform that connects talented home cooks with consumers craving authenticity.

- **Convenience Seekers**: Some students prioritize convenience and affordability over cooking, suggesting a demand for a service offering healthy, reasonably priced, home-cooked meals.

- **Quality and Price Conscious Consumers**: Concerns over the inconsistency and high pricing of restaurant offerings were common, highlighting a need for a community-driven platform providing access to authentic, reasonably priced meals.

- **Culinary Exchange Enthusiasts**: A keen home cook interested in sharing culinary experiences suggests the potential for a network fostering culinary exchanges, enriching dining experiences through shared dishes and skills.

- **Vegetarian Diners**: The struggle to find variety and affordability in vegetarian dining options points to a significant market demand for services catering to vegetarians seeking diverse, home-cooked meals.

- **Budget-conscious Diners**: The high mark-ups in restaurants have pushed some towards seeking alternative dining solutions, indicating a market for a cost-effective meal service offering authentic food at home-cooked affordability.
